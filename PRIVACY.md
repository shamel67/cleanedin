**Effective Date:** March 27, 2025

CleanedIn is a Chrome browser extension designed to reduce distractions and help you focus while using LinkedIn.

## 1. Information Collection

CleanedIn does **not collect, store, or transmit any personal data**. The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not send any information to external servers.

We do **not use any tracking technologies**. CleanedIn does not use cookies, analytics tools, or any form of user behavior tracking.

## 3. Data Sharing and Selling

We do **not share, sell, or disclose any information** to third parties, simply because we don’t collect any data in the first place.
